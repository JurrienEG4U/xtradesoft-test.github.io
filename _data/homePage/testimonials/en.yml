    We were able to consolidate all of our 5 multi-facility venues into one fully integrated solution, streamlining membership administration for all of our 5.000 members, green fee sales, but also theÂ operation of pro shops
    and our restaurants. The insights gained from the embedded, flexible customer profiling allows us to optimise and service the consumption habits of our customer groups with tailor-made membership types. The pricing
    rules and an online tee time widget keep us in full control of our pricing policy, thereby fostering our digital marketing and sales activities.
